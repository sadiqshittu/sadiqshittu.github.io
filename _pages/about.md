Bio
======
I am a master's student in advanced computer science at Newcastle University. My research interest lies in human-centered security and privacy, focusing on how human factors influence issues related to system’s security and privacy. 

Previously, I received my BS in computer science with first-class honours from Fountain University Osogbo and a National Diploma in Computer Science from Federal Polytechnic Bida, Nigeria.
