Bio
I am an incoming doctoral student at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, with a research focus on human-centered cybersecurity and privacy. Specifically, I am interested in using empirical methods to explore how end users influence computer security and privacy issues. I previously received my MS from Newcastle University, under the supervision of [Professor Thomas Groß](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/staff/profile/thomasgross.html), and earned a BS in Computer Science with First-Class Honours from Fountain University Osogbo, where I was supervised by [Dr. Mohammed Lawal](https://fuo.edu.ng/personnel/lawal-mohammed/).
