Bio
======
I am a doctoral student in the [USER Lab](https://userlab.utk.edu/) at the University of Tennessee, advised by [Dr. Scott Ruoti](https://userlab.utk.edu/scott-ruoti). I am studying how users manage cryptographic keys in practice.

I earned an M.Sc. with Distinction from Newcastle University, supervised by [Professor Thomas Groß](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/staff/profile/thomasgross.html), and a First-Class B.Sc. in Computer Science from Fountain University Osogbo, under [Dr. Mohammed Lawal](https://fuo.edu.ng/personnel/lawal-mohammed/).
